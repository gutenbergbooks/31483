<h2>PREFACE TO MOTHERS.</h2>

<p>Many and many a time mothers have come
to the author with the piteous plaint: "O
Aunt Fanny! we are perfectly worn out with
your 'Nightcaps,' 'Mittens,' and 'Socks;'
we have read them to our little children,
who have not yet conquered the compound
mysteries of the alphabet, until we know
them by heart; do, <i>do</i> write some books
in words of one syllable, which they can
read for themselves."</p>

<p>Now, I wonder if these good mothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
can conceive what it is to write a story in
words of one syllable, and make it interesting,
sensible, and grammatical? If they
can not, I entreat them to try a page or
two of this utterly distracting style of composition;
they will very soon have a realizing
sense of the pleasing emotions of a
lunatic confined in a strait-jacket. Above
all, let them try a tale of joy or woe, all
in words of three letters and less. Mother
Goose could never have made her precious
"high-diddle-diddle" nonsense in this way.
I have tried frantically to spell "jolly" in
three letters and "darling" in one syllable.
How I have succeeded the books are submitted
to show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>The mothers have wanted them, and I have
written them&mdash;begging pardon of Mother
Goose and Mr. Murray&mdash;and entreating that
all short-comings, which in this case will
mean all words too long, will be set down
to want of power, not want of will, to
delight and amuse the dear little darlings,
the writing for whom is so rare a comfort
to their loving</p>

<p>ne day Ned got
a pie to eat. It
was too hot, so
he put it out in
the air, on the
lid of a big tin pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>And now he ran off to see
his dog who had a pup, and
his cat who had a kit.</p>

<p>The pup lay in a box.
Ned had got hay to put in
the box for a bed; the pup
lay on the hay, and the kit
lay on a bit of rug.</p>

<p>Ned did pat the pup on his
ear, and say: "O you pet!
let me hug you." By and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
by, he did pat the kit too,
and say: "Kit, kit, kit, can
you eat pie&mdash;can you? Let
me go and get you a bit."
So he ran to his pie&mdash;but, O
my! it was not on the lid of
the big tin pot.</p>

<p>"Why, who <i>can</i> it be
who has got my pie?" Ned
did say. "Did it fly up in
the air?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>"Why, Hal! did <i>you</i> get
my pie?"</p>

<p>"No, not I. It is a tom-tit
you see&mdash;not a pie."</p>

<p>"O yes! so it is, a wee
tom-tit. If I can get my pie,
the tom-tit, and you and I
can eat it."</p>

<p>He got up on top of the
tin pot to see far off, and
he did cry out: "O my! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
see it now! I see my pie!
The sly old ape has got it,
and he has eat a big bit out
of it, too! Oh! oh! he will
eat it all up! How can I
get at him?"</p>

<p>And now the sly old ape,
who had the pie in his paw,
saw Ned, and Ned did say:
"Now for a run!" So he did
run, and the sly old ape did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
run, and the dog did run,
and the cat did run, and the
pup did run, and the kit did
run, and all did run, and it
was fun.</p>

<p>The ape did say, "Che!
che!" and ate the pie as he
ran. Ned did say: "O you
bad old ape! O you bad
old ape!" The dog did say:
"Bow wow! Bow wow!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
The cat did say: "Mew,
mew!" The pup did say:
"Yap! yap!" and the kit did
cry: "Eee, eee!" Was it not
a big run?</p>

<p>And now, was it not too
bad in the sly old ape? for
you see he ate the pie all up.
Ned did not get one bit, and
the kit did not get one bit.
O my!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>Let me say to you, if you
get a pie, and it is too hot
to eat, do not put it on the
top of a big tin pot, in the
air, and go off to see a cat or
a dog, for if you do, may be
a sly old ape may get at the
pie, and eat it all up.</p>

<p>boy was
out one
day. It
was <a name="Sam" id="Sam"></a>Sam.
He had
his new
hum <a name="top" id="top"></a>top.
He did
say to his mam-ma: "Oh! see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
my top! Can I go out and
try my new hum top?"</p>

</div>

<p>"Yes, my son, but do not
go into the old hut."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, mam-ma," Sam
did say; and out he ran in
the air.</p>

<p>By and by, a big boy did
run up to him and say: "Sam,
let me try the top? oh! do."</p>

<p>Sam let the big boy try,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and, O my! how the top did
go! and did hum, hum, hum
so, Sam did say it was a big
bee.</p>

<p>But, oh! sad to say, the
big boy did let the top fly
off in-to the hut; and Sam
did not do as he was bid, for
he ran in to get it.</p>

<p>He saw an ax in the hut.</p>

<p>"Oh! see the ax," Sam did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
say, "I can try it on the old
log, out in the lot; yes, I can
see if it can cut."</p>

<p>Was he not a bad boy to
say so? for his mam-ma did
say to him one day: "You
are but a bit of a boy; so
you can not do as a big man
can do. Do not get the ax;
if you do, you may cut off a
leg or an arm, and you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
die; so do not go to the hut
at all, and to-day, too, she
did say: "Do not go to the
hut."</p>

<p>But the bad boy got the
ax, and ran out to the old
log.</p>

<p>And now, oh! oh! I am
sad to say the ax did not
cut the log. No! it cut off
Sam's big toe!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>How he did cry and hop!
His mam-ma ran out, and saw
her boy out by the log; the
ax was by him, and his big
toe was off.</p>

<p>It is no fun at all to get a
big toe cut off, for Sam had
to lie in bed, and cry all day;
and the pig ate up his big
toe.</p>

<p>He can not buy a new toe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
He has but one big toe now.
So you see how bad it is not
to do as you are bid.</p>

</div>
<p>an you go out to
the see-saw to-day?"
Sue did
say to Ben.</p>

<p>"O yes, yes!
Let me see if mam-ma will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
let us. Yes, we can go: so
you put on a hat, and let me
get my cap, and we can run
all the way."</p>

<p>Ben got his cap off of the
peg, and Sue got her hat out
of a box; and the two ran off.
Tip, the big dog, ran too.</p>

<p>On the top of the see-saw
sat an old cat; she sat on it,
to try to spy out a rat, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
had hid. The cat did not see
Tip; and, I am sad to say, he
was now a bad dog; for he ran
at her, and bit her in the leg.</p>

<p>The cat put up her paw to
hit Tip, and Tip bit her in her
ear; and the cat had to run
off with a m-e-w! O my!
was not Tip a bad dog?</p>

<p>And now Sue and Ben got
on the see-saw. Sue did go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
up, up, up, and Ben did go
up, up, up. And it was fun!
Was it not?</p>

<p>Tip had his fun too, for he
saw the rat. It had hid in a
box by the see-saw, and the
cat did not see it; but Tip
did; and oh! how he did fly
at it! He got it in his paw
and bit it, so it did die. The
rat did not say it was fun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
be out at the see-saw, as Ben
and Sue did. O no! It was
no fun at all to be bit, and
to die. Was it?</p>

<p>And now the sun was hot,
and Ben and Sue got off the
see-saw and ran up to the
old red cow, to see her eat
hay, and out to the pig sty
to see the old fat pig, who
ate all day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>"O my!" Sue did say, "see
how fat the pig is! All she
can do is to eat all day. I
can not eat all day; can you
Ben?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," Ben did say,
"but I can eat one big pie
in a day."</p>

<p>"Oh! so can I! Let us
go in and ask mam-ma for a
pie to eat now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>So the two ran, and Tip
ran. And mam-ma <i>had</i> a
pie; she cut it up for Sue
and Ben to eat, and they did
hop for joy and eat it all up.</p>

<p>"Did they? No! I can
not say so, for Ben gave Tip,
the dog, a big bit; and Sue
did too. Ben was not a pig,
and Sue was not a pig. So,
you see, the two did not eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
as the pig did; no! for Tip
had his bit too.</p>

</div>
<p>ne day Ben did
go up to his pa-pa,
and say: "O
pa-pa! my cap is
so old, it is not fit
to be put on; do buy me a
new one!"</p>

<p>His pa-pa did say: "If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
are not bad all day, I can say
'yes' to you, but if you are
bad, the old cap will do for a
bad boy."</p>

<p>But Ben was not bad; so
his pa-pa got him the cap. It
had fur on it. Ben put it on;
and as it fit him, he ran out in
the air, and did cry as he ran:
"See my new cap! see my
new cap!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Far off, by an old log, he
saw a fat hen. She was by
her nest. In it was an egg.
Ben ran up to her, and he did
cry, "Sho! sho! sho!" till she
did fly off. So he got the old
hen's egg, and put it in the
top of his cap. As he did so
a boy ran up to him. It was
Bob. "Hal-lo," Bob did say.
"How do you do, Ben?" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
he hit him a tap on the top
of his cap. He did not see
Ben put the egg in his cap;
and, O my! the egg did go
pop!! and it ran in his ear
and his eye, and all on him
from top to toe. His new cap
was all egg too.</p>

<p>So you see how bad it was
in him not to let the old fat
hen and her egg be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>But he did not care a bit;
for he and Bob ran off to see
the men mow the hay. It lay
in the hot sun to dry.</p>

<p>Bob lay on the hay, and
the sun was so hot, that the
end of his nose got red, and
a big dog who was by the
men saw the end of his nose,
and ran and made a snap at
it to eat it. But Ben did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
hop up, and he and Bob ran
off.</p>

<p>Ben did go in to his mam-ma
and say: "O mam-ma! we
are so hot and so dry! do let
us get a pie to eat and a big
tin mug of wa-ter; and oh!
may we put a big bit of ice
in the tin mug?"</p>

<p>His mam-ma did say, Yes;
and so Ben and Bob did eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the pie and had a lot of fun;
for Ben bit his pie to look like
a cat who had one leg, and
Bob bit his pie in-to a dog
who had one ear. He ate it
all up; and Bob did say he
had a dog-pie, and Ben had
a cat-pie. Was it not fun?</p>

<p>But his pa-pa did say to
him: "Why, Ben, how did you
get all the egg on you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>O how red Ben was! But
he did not say a lie. O no!
He did say: "Pa-pa, I got an
egg and put it in the top of
my new cap, but Bob did not
see it, and he did tap the top
of my cap, and the egg did go
pop! all on me, and the top
of my new cap is all egg.
How can I get it off?"</p>

<p>His pa-pa was full of joy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
as his son did not say a lie,
and he did try to get all the
egg off of the new cap. And
now Ben and Bob ran off, and
Ben had a lot of fun, for he
was not bad; O no! he was a
boy who did not say a lie, and
so he had joy and fun all day.

gone. Not as much as a
bit the size of a pin's head
was left in the hole.</p>

<p>So the wee rats all got
in a row, and held up two
paws each, and in a sad
tone did cry: "O pa-pa!
O mam-ma!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We want some cake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We want some tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We want some pie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eee! eee! eee! eee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Then a tear came out of
each eye, and ran down each
nose, and made the hole as
damp as a bath-tub.</p>

<p>"O my poor dear boys!"
said the old rat, "do stop!
You will make me cry too;"
and he put his paw to his
eye. "I will go and see what
I can get you for your tea
e-e-e-e. Come, give me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
hug, and kiss me for good-by,
for that big cat I told
you of may get hold of me,
and bite my head off. If
she does so, this is the last
you will see of your poor
pa-pa."</p>

<p>At this all the nine boy-rats
set up a cry, and gave
him such hard hugs, that the
old rat had to slap one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
two to make them stop.
Then, with a hop, skip, and
jump, he was up at the top
of the hole.</p>

<p>"No one here," he said;
so he gave one hop more,
and was out in the room.</p>

<p>It was a big room, but
nice and warm. The sun
had set, and it was dark;
but the old rat saw by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
fire that no one was in it.
The cook had gone out in
the yard to get more wood
to put on the fire, and the
cat had gone out in the
yard too, to have a talk,
on the top of the wall,
with the gray cat who came
from next door. And now
the old rat did hear the two
cats say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"M-e-w! m-i-a-u!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">M-i-a-u! m-e-w!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ffts! ffts! ffts!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How are <i>you</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Bless me!" said the old
rat, "why, how they talk!
how they snap and spit!
Why! the gray cat next
door will bite off our cat's
nose in no time at all, if
they go on this way! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
hope he <i>will</i> bite it off, for,
you see, if she has no nose
she can not find me out."</p>

<p>The old rat gave a wink
of his eye, and a slap of
his tail, as he said this;
and then it was high time
to poke his nose in and out
of the pots and pans, to see
what was in them.</p>

<p>By and by, that nose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
his took off the lid of a box.
"Now for a peep to see
what is in-side," said the old
gray rat. "Now let us see
what I can put my paw on
this time."</p>

<p>My! what eyes he made
when he saw ten new laid
eggs in the box.</p>

<p>"Why! here is one for
each of my nine boys, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
one more," he said. "What
fun to suck them! But I
must get them into my hole
as soon as you can say 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or
the cook will come in, and
the cat too."</p>

<p>And now he had a hard
time; for when the rat did
try to take an egg up in
one paw, it was so big that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
pop! it went with a roll
back in the box.</p>

<p>Then he did try to take
it in two paws, and hop on
his hind legs; but he soon
had to stop that. Then he
did try to roll it to his hole,
but the egg went all to one
side, as much as to say:
"How dare you try to roll
me into your hole? I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
not your egg. Let me be,
you bad old rat!"</p>

<p>Yes, he was a bad old rat,
for he took what was not his.
Mind <i>you</i> do not do so, my
dear pet. Do not take a
pin, or a bit of cake, or
pie, but ask your mam-ma
if you can have it; then
you can eat it with joy.</p>

<p>But the old gray rat did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
not know it was so bad.
<i>You</i> know, but the rat had
no one to tell him as you
have.</p>

<p>"E-e-e-e!" said the ten
wee rats in the hole:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We want our tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eee-ee! ee-ee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"O dear!" said the old
gray rat, "if I had some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
one to help me! O dear!"
He put his paw on the end
of his nose, and then all at
once gave a jump for joy
in the air. "Good! good!
good!" he did cry; "I have
it! I can get all the eggs
in the hole."</p>

<p>"Come here, Bet!" he said
to his wife. "Come out,
all of you, and help me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Up they came with a hop,
skip, and jump, all ears and
eyes, and each tail gave a
slap on the side of the wall,
it came out with <i>such</i> a
jerk.</p>

<p>"Here we are, my dear,"
said old Bet, the rat's wife.
"Come; go to work as fast
as you can. I hear the cat."</p>

<p>"Well, you and I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
go out to the mill, to get a
wisp of hay to tie my legs
with."</p>

<p>"Tie your legs!" said his
wife, "Why! what <i>do</i> you
mean?"</p>

<p>But she was a good wife,
and knew how to mind; so
she went with the old rat,
and they got a fine long
wisp of hay, and ran back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
to the eggs and the nine
rat-boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i012.jpg" id="i012.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i012.jpg" width="500" height="344" alt="Rats with hay" title="Rats with Hay" />
    <p class="caption">"They got a fine long wisp of hay."&mdash;<a href="#Page_80">P. 80.</a><br /><br /></p>
</div>

<p>And now the old rat-wife
and the nine rat-boys soon
knew what a dear, good pa-pa
they had; for, sure as you
live! he made a cart of him-self.
Down he went flat on
his back with all four paws
up in the air.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
to his wife, "lay an egg in-side
of my legs, then tie my
paws up with the wisp of
hay, so the egg can not fall
out; then you and all the
boys take hold of my tail,
and drag me and the egg to
the hole."</p>

<p>"Oh! what fun!" said all
the nine rats; "let's give the
egg a good ride. Now, then,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh! pull, boys, pull!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eee-ee! eee-ee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll get our nine eggs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home for tea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So each one took a bit of
the long tail in his lips, and
did try not to bite his pa-pa,
and as they sung, "Pull,
boys, pull," they drew the
egg in high glee to the edge
of the hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>But Nip, the one who was
at the end, did try so hard
to pull, that, all at once,
snap! he had bit off the end
of his pa-pa's tail.</p>

<p>"Ki-i! kii!! e-e-e!!!" said
the poor old gray rat, "you
bad, bad boy, to bite me so!
Now you can not have a bit
of egg. You must go with-out
your tea."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>"O pa-pa! I did not mean
to! O my!" Nip did say.</p>

<p>"Go down in the hole and
stay till we come. You must
not help one bit more."</p>

<p>So the wee rat had to go;
but, O dear! what <i>will</i> you
say, when I tell you that he
ate up the end of his pa-pa's
tail, and then gave a snap of
his lips, as much as to say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
"Dear me! that was nice!
How I do wish I had some
more!"</p>

<p>The rest did pull, till the
egg was at the hole. Then
old Bet, the wife, went down,
and the rest took off the
wisp of hay, and gave the
egg a push, so that it fell
in her fore-paws. Then they
all went back for more, till,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
at last, the nine eggs were
safe in the hole.</p>

<p>What fun it was!</p>

<p>Just as the last of the
nine rat-boys had gone with
a hop, skip, and jump, down
the hole, the old cook came
back in the room.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, "how nice
the fire does burn! I will fry
some of the eggs the hens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
have just laid for tea." She
went to the box and saw
that the lid was off, and all
the eggs were gone!!!</p>

<p>She did look in the box,
as if the eggs were out for
a walk, and were to come
back in half an hour, and it
was time for them to come
now. But no eggs did she
see; and the old cook did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
cry out at last: "Why, who
in all the land has been at
my eggs? I put them in
the box, I am sure."</p>

<p>Then she did look in all
the jars and cups; in the big
blue bowl, and the four tin
pans, and the new red pail;
but not an egg did she find.</p>

<p>Down in the hole the rats
had a good time, I can tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
you! Yes, all of them; for
the old gray rat, when he
got safe home, laid the end
of his tail on a bit of soft
wool, so that it did not hurt
him much, and then he gave
the rat-boy Nip, who had bit
it off, a kiss, and said he
did not mean to take away
his tea now, as he was so
sad. Then the rat-boy said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
"Oh! I am so glad, I will
jump up to the moon for
joy." And so they all had
a fine time.</p>

<p>The old gray rat made a
hole in the big end of an
egg, and gave it to his wife
to suck. Not a drop came
out! "Why, how is this?"
she said, "it is as full as it
can be!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>"Try a hole here," said the
old gray rat, and he took the
egg and made one on the
top of it. Oh! then it came
out as fast as you like, and
you may be sure that Bet,
the rat-wife, soon ate it all up.</p>

<p>Then the wise old rat
made two holes in each egg,
and all his nine boys gave
him one suck out of each,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and ate the rest, and had a
real good time.</p>

<p>Now if you have a mind,
and your mam-ma will let
you, just try to suck an egg
with one hole in it: you will
find that none will come out;
but if you make two, one
at each end, you will get it
all. A wise man told me
this, so it must be true; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
I do not like to try it, for
raw egg is not good.</p>

<p>The old gray rat was wise
too; but as for the poor old
cook she does not know,
from that day to this, who
took all her nice eggs. If
I were you, I'd go and tell
her it was the old gray rat.</p>

<p>When you go, won't you
take me with you, dear pet?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
We will peep in the hole,
and try to see the old rat
and his wife and his nine
boys.</p>

<p>That is all this time; so,
good-by.</p>

<h2>POOR WILL,</h2>
<h3>WHO WAS SHOT IN THE WAR.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
    <a name="i013.jpg" id="i013.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i013.jpg" width="75" height="91" alt="Illustrated letter I" title="Illustrated Letter I" />
</div>
<p>t is a fine warm
day in June.
Out of the town
the air is soft
and pure. Bird
and bee flit from tree to tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
from blue-bell to rose, till at
sun-set they hie away to nest
and hive.</p>

<p>Bell and Lou were at play
in a nice room in a home out
of the town. They came to
this dear home each year
when it grew warm. Bell
was hard at work with some
bits of wood. "See, Lou,"
she said, "see my log hut;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
when it is done, your doll Fan
can come and live in it."</p>

<p>"Oh! do not let it fall, Bell,
for poor Fan is sick. She has
got fits in her ear and all her
ten toes. I have just put her
in bed. Put your arm in the
bed, my pet," she said to the
doll in a kind tone; "you
will get cold; and here, take
this blue pill, dear. Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
make such a face. Poor soul!
<i>so</i> sick! Has my pet got fits?
So she has! O my!" So
she gave Fan a kind pat, and
then went with a soft step
to look out at the door.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i014.jpg" id="i014.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i014.jpg" width="500" height="405" alt="Fan is sick" title="Fan Is Sick" />
    <p class="caption">"Oh! do not let it fall, Bell, for poor Fan is sick."&mdash;<a href="#Page_98">P. 98.</a><br /><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Soon she ran back and
said: "O Bell! do come
here! Come and look at
the poor old man at the
door. Why, I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
how it is, but I can see but
one arm. O dear! if he has
but one, how sad it is! Come,
look!"</p>

<p>Bell laid down her bits of
wood, tho' her log hut was
'most done, and ran with Lou.</p>

<p>The out-side door had not
been shut, for it was such a
warm day. The soft west
wind blew in, and the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
lay hot on the wide door-step.</p>

<p>"Come here, poor man,"
said Bell, "come to Lou and
me; we want to talk to you."</p>

<p>He came with a slow, sad
step. His face was thin and
pale, his eyes were dim, and
the long gray hair that fell
on each side, made him look
so sad! But it was a kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
good face, and Lou and Bell
did not fear to call him to
them.</p>

<p>"Have you been to the
war?" said Lou.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>"Did you lose your arm in
the war?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was shot off; but,
O miss! I do not mind my
arm. It is my boy, my dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Will, I want back, my own
dear son. Oh! why did I let
him go?"</p>

<p>"Why did you?" said Bell,
"you did not want a boy to
go to the sad wars to be shot,
did you? Why did you not
take care of him?"</p>

<p>A big tear came out of
the poor man's eye, as Bell
said this. It fell down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
thin face. He put up the
back of his hand and took
the tear off. Then he said:
"I have been cold; I know
what it is to have no food to
eat; I have had no bed to
lie on: I can bear all this
with-out a sigh; but, oh! I
can not bear the loss of my
Will, my dear boy!"</p>

<p>"Poor man!" said Lou,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
"come sit down by us, and
tell us how your boy came
to go to the war; tell us all."</p>

<p>"Well, miss, if you wish to
hear such a sad tale, I will
tell you. When the war came
I had to go and help on our
side. Then Will said: 'Oh!
if you go, I must go too. You
know I can beat the drum, if
I can not beat the bad men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
who will try to do all they
can to hurt us.'"</p>

<p>"Then I said: 'O no! Will;
I can not let you go. They
will kill you.'</p>

<p>"'Why, who can want to
kill a boy like me? Come,
dear pa-pa, do let me go; I
want to be with you, I love
you so much. If you get
hurt, I can take care of you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and then I can beat the drum,
or play on a fife. Do, dear
pa-pa, let me go with you;
I will keep out of the way
of the big guns. Oh! I want
to go.'</p>

<p>"At last I said: 'Well, Will,
you may go.' He was so glad,
he gave a leap of wild joy.
I was glad too, for I did love
him so much. I felt that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
had no one to love or care for
but him. My wife was dead,
and my Will was my all. If
I went with-out him, he was
to go and live with an old
aunt whom he did not know.
So I said: 'Will, you can be
with me in my tent, and we
will not part at all.'"</p>

<p>"How old was he?" said
Lou.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>"He was ten, but tall of
his age." Then the poor man
gave a deep sigh and went
on: "Oh! he was so glad;
but it made me sigh to look
at my boy. He was in a glow
all the time; he was sure we
would win, and come back to
our home full of joy.</p>

<p>"They gave him a drum,
and a cap, and a blue coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
with a big cape like the rest
of us, and in his belt they put
a dirk. When Will put them
on, he felt as fine as a new
pin. Said he: 'I mean to pull
out my dirk, and poke it at all
the bad men who try to get a
shot at you. Then I will get
up in a tree, and beat my
drum as hard as I can, to call
our men out to help me kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
them. See if I don't! Oh!
what fun it will be!'</p>

<p>"My dear boy! he did not
know what fear was."</p>

<p>Each day, as soon as he
was out of bed, he came to
kiss me, and tell me how glad
he was that I had let him go
with me; 'for I love you,' he
said, 'I can love no one else
as I love you. Oh! do take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
care of your-self; do try not
to get shot or hurt: if you
die, I must die too.'"</p>

<p>Here Bell and Lou saw a
big tear roll down on each
side of the poor man's face;
they had hard work not to
cry too. Lou said in a low,
soft tone: "Poor man, we are
so sad for you!"</p>

<p>"You are a good girl," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the old man; "and tho' it will
give me so much pain, I will
tell you the rest.</p>

<p>"We went to the war, and
Will was with me in my tent.
All the men did love him, he
was so good, and just as full
of glee as a bird. He sang
all day, and beat his drum so
well, that the men said he was
as good as a band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>"One day we were told to
load our guns, and not to say
a loud word. We knew then
that the time was come; that
bad men were on our path to
kill us. I took Will to the
back of the camp. I put my
arm on his neck; I gave him
a kiss full of love, and I said:
'O my dear son! do not come
near the guns; they will kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
you if you do. You know
you can beat your drum out
here. Good-by, and God bless
and keep you safe.' Then I
gave him one more kiss, and
he gave me a hug and a
kiss&mdash;the last but one I had
from my dear boy, the last
kiss of my Will. Oh! why
did I let him come?</p>

<p>"All that day we did load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and fire our guns, and the bad
men did fire at us. The dead
lay at our feet. We did not
take them up; we had no
time; but when the sun had
set, we went out to find our
men who had died, to wrap
them in our flag, and lay them
down in the last rest. We
knew our men, for the pale,
sad moon lit up each face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
As we took them up, we did
pray to God for each soul that
had gone. We did pray that
each one who had died for
his dear land was in joy with
Him.</p>

<p>"As we went on, one of the
men gave a low cry, and said:
'Why here is a poor boy! O
dear! he has been shot; he
is dead! How did such a boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
come here?' I did not dare
to go up and look; but one of
our own men went near; he
gave one look, and then said
in a low, sad tone: 'It is our
Will.'</p>

<p>"Oh! then I ran and fell
down by my boy, my dear
dead boy. He lay on his
face; he did not stir.</p>

<p>"I took his hand in mine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and did turn his dear face so
that I could see it. With
sobs I took him up in my
arms. He was yet warm, and
a hope rose in me that he was
not dead. Yes, the good God
did not let him die then, for
he gave a low moan of pain,
tho' his eyes were yet shut.</p>

<p>"And so I took him to my
tent, and laid him down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
my bed, and sat by him in
the dark. All I could do was
to wet his lips, and sob and
pray to God for my boy.</p>

<p>"At last, at dawn of day, I
saw that his blue eyes were
open, and he said with a sigh:
'Pa-pa, is that you?' Oh!
what joy I felt! but my joy
was not for long, for my boy
was so weak, he said but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
word or two from time to
time. I will tell you what
he said, 'Pa-pa, I <i>did</i> stay
back just as you told me,
but a shot from a big gun
flew in the air, and went in
here,' and he put his hand on
his left side. 'I fell down,
and all at once it grew dark
to me, and I knew I must
die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>"'Then I did try to get to
you to bid you good-by, and
to give you one last good kiss.
The shot fell like rain; they
made a buzz, buzz in the air.
I went from end to end of the
line of men to find you, but I
did not see you; then the guns
did not fire, for the sun had
set; but I was so weak I fell
down. I did lift my arms up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to the sky, and pray: O God!
let me see my own dear pa-pa,
to kiss him, and tell him
that I did do as he had bid
me. I can not get back to the
camp; I must die here. And
then I knew no more. But
God did hear me; and now I
can bid you good-by, and beg
you not to cry for me when I
am gone.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>"'O Will!' I said with a
sob, "you must not die. I
will not let you. Oh! do you
hear? I will not let you go
from me.'</p>

<p>"Just then the kind doc-tor
came in; for it was now Will's
turn. He did look at his side;
he felt his brow and his cold
hand; then he gave me a look,
a sad, sad look&mdash;it said: 'It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
is no use to try, I can not
save him.'</p>

<p>"And now my Will's face
grew pale and pale; his head
sank down; his blue eyes were
dim. He put his hand out to
me, for now he did not see
me; I took it, and laid it on
my neck. He drew my face,
all wet with big tears, down
to his, and I could just hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
him say: 'I love you, O how
I love you! But God calls
me; I will wait for you at
His feet. Good-by.' Then
he gave me his last kiss, and
then&mdash;he was dead."</p>

<p>The poor old man hid his
face in his hand. His sobs
were so sad to hear, that Bell
and Lou felt as bad as the
poor man, and did cry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
sob with him, and wish the
war had ne-ver come, to give
all this woe and pain to a
good man.</p>

<p>At last the old man got up
to go. Then Bell said to Lou
in a low tone: "Let us give
this poor man the gold coin
we have had so long. It will
buy him a new coat."</p>

<p>"O yes, yes!" said Lou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
So she ran in and got it, and
then they both said: "Here,
good old man, take this; it
will not make you less sad for
the loss of your dear boy, but
it will buy you food or a coat;
we beg you to take it."</p>

<p>With a look of love at
those dear ones who were so
kind, the old man took the
gold. "May God bless you!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
said he. "You are His own
lambs. I will pray for you;
and when you die and I die,
may we all meet my own
dear Will, who is now with
Him, safe from the pain and
sin of this life."</p>

<p>Then he bade them good-by,
and went with slow and
sad steps down the road.</p>

<h2>ANN, THE GOOD GIRL;</h2>
<h4>OR,</h4>
<h3>IS IT BEST TO MIND OR NOT TO MIND?</h3>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;dear! dear!"
said Ann, in
a fret, "how it
does rain! It
is just pour, pour all the time.
When <i>will</i> it stop? Why must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
it rain when I want to go out?
The sky is like a big gray pan
up-side down, and so low it
will fall on top of the hill, if
it does not mind. What is
the use of rain? O my! I do
wish the sun was out."</p>

<p>"Come here, my dear," said
her mam-ma, in a soft, kind
tone, "will you help me with
this blue yarn? I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
wind it, and then knit it into
mitts for the good men who
have gone to the war."</p>

<p>"O dear! yes, mam-ma, I
am glad to do that; to be
sure I will."</p>

<p>You see Ann was not a bad
girl; but she had no work to
do, and she did not want to
play just then with Miss Kate
June, her new doll. Ann had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
been born in June, and just as
sure as each new June came,
she got a new doll for a gift
from her mam-ma.</p>

<p>Miss Kate June made six
dolls that she had; so you can
tell by that how old she was.</p>

<p>And now she held the blue
yarn, and mam-ma soon made
a big ball of it. She had just
got to the end, when down fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the ball out of her hand. A
gray kit was on the rug; and
when the ball fell, she was
sure it was for her to play
with; so she flew to get it,
and Ann flew to get it too;
and both had such fun, and
a real good romp!</p>

<p>Dear me! how the ball did
roll! and how the kit did
jump! and how Ann did run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to get it! and what a nice
time they both had! Ann's
blue eyes were full of glee,
and let me tell you, she did
not look out once at the rain.</p>

<p>At last she got the ball
away from the kit, and gave
it to her mam-ma, with a kiss.</p>

<p>Then mam-ma said: "Do
you care for the rain now?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>"Will you do some more
work for me?"</p>

<p>"O yes! mam-ma, I like to
work for you;" and a soft
look of love came into her
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I like to
have you. And now, for fear
the kit will want to jump up
in my lap to get at my ball,
just tie this bit of tape to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
cork, and hang it on that nail
in the wall. Now, give it a
toss to and fro, and you will
see kit jump at once to bite
it, and tap it with her paw."</p>

<p>Ann did as she was bid.
She gave the cork a toss in
the air, when up flew the kit
like a shot. She hit it with
both paws; she did jump up
with all four of her legs high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in the air; and you may be
sure that she had no end of
fun and play.</p>

<p>Just then, old Aunt Peg,
the cook, came in. She was
a good old soul, tho' her face
was so dark, and her hair
was made of wool. She was
so fond of Ann, she did just
what the wee girl told her to
do. If Ann went to Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Peg, and put her soft hands
on the neck of the old cook,
and laid her head on her dark
hand, and said, "O dear Aunt
Peg! do make me a pie to-day,
and I will love you <i>so</i>
much," then, let me tell you,
Aunt Peg set to work at
once, and a fine pie was made
in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Well, this day, Aunt Peg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
said: "What am I to cook,
ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said mam-ma, "we
will have some ham and eggs,
and peas, and rice, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Pie!</i>" said Ann. "O yes!
you must make me a big pie,
Aunt Peg, or you will get
your head shot off."</p>

<p>"O good-y! I hope not,
Miss Ann," said Aunt Peg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
"If you cut my head off, I
shall hop up and down like
the poor hen who flew in our
yard from next door with her
head off; and then all the
pies you will get will be the
dirt pies you make your-self;
and they are not as good to
eat as mine, are they?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I was in fun, dear
Aunt Peg," said Ann. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
must not have your dear old
head cut off;" and she ran up
to the cook, and took her
hand, and gave it two soft,
kind pats.</p>

<p>Then the good old soul
went off to make the pie,
and fry the ham and eggs,
and boil the peas and rice.</p>

<p>Ann sat down to make a
red silk bag for her mam-ma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to keep her ball of blue yarn
in. It was not more than half
done, when all at once the
rain did stop, and a sun-beam
came like a dart in the room,
and lit on the end of Ann's
nose. "Why! look at the
sun!" said she with a cry of
joy, and ran to the door.</p>

<p>The sky was blue; the
sun's rays made each drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of rain look like a gem; and
when a bird flew past Ann
with a wild song of joy, Ann
sang too, she was so glad.
The bees went to work with
a will, to make up for the
time they had lost by the
rain; and they flew home to
the hive with bags full of
food, you may be sure.</p>

<p>Then Ann came in to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
her hat, and flew out once
more, as gay as a lark, when
her mam-ma said: "Come
back, come back, my dear;
it is too wet; you must wait
till the sun has been out some
time. If you get your feet
wet, you will take cold."</p>

<p>O dear me! Ann did not
like this a bit; but, as I have
told you, she was a <i>good girl</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and did as she was bid. She
did not say, "What for?" or
"<i>Why</i> must I do so?" No;
she came in at once, and sat
down to work at her bag.</p>

<p>And now you will see how
good it is to mind.</p>

<p>Ann had not sat long,
when all at once a loud cry
came to her ears. She held
up her head and said: "Hush!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
hush! what was that?" Then
she ran to look out, as if she
had six pair of eyes, when a
howl and a bark, and a loud
roar, made her jump, and then
a boy ran past like the wind.
His hair was on end; his face
was pale with fear. As he
ran he said: "O save me!
O help! help! Save me from
the <span class="smcap">mad dog</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>The dog was at the poor
boy's heels, and four or five
men, each with a big club,
did run and try to get at the
mad dog to kill him.</p>

<p>And now the boy ran for
his life. He was in such fear,
he did not see a log of wood
that was in his path; so he
fell down on it, and then, O
sad to tell! the mad dog, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a howl of rage, made a dash
at his leg and bit it.</p>

<p>The men got at the dog,
and hit him on the head till
he died. But it was too late!
it was too late! the poor boy
had been bit, and he must
die too.</p>

<p>Then mam-ma took her
dear girl in her arms, and
gave her a kiss, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
"Oh! how glad I am you
did not go out to play! God
has kept my dear pet from
harm, and He has made you
a good girl. If you had run
out when I told you not to
go, and the mad dog had bit
you too&mdash;O dear! I can not
bear to think of it."</p>

<p>"But <i>must</i> the poor boy
die?" said Ann, as a big tear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
came out of her blue eye;
"Oh! must he die, mam-ma?"</p>

<p>"I fear he will. They will
try to save his life. They will
cut a big hole in his leg where
the dog bit him, and put him
to sad pain. But the bite of
a mad dog is so hard to cure,
I fear it will be of no use."</p>

<p>"O mam-ma! will you let
me take him some of Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Peg's nice cake? It may do
him good. Do let me!"</p>

<p>Her mam-ma said yes, tho'
she knew it was of no use; for
the poor boy was too much
hurt to eat. She did not tell
Ann so, for she did not wish
to make her more sad.</p>

<p>So some cake was made,
and Ann went with a good
lad who knew the way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i016.jpg" id="i016.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i016.jpg" width="500" height="488" alt="It was sad" title="It Was Sad" />
    <p class="caption">"Oh! how sad it was!"&mdash;<a href="#Page_153">P. 153.</a><br /><br /></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>Oh! how sad it was! The
poor boy lay in bed. His face
was pale, and his eyes were
shut. He did not say one
word, but just lay on his bed,
as if he were dead.</p>

<p>Ann gave the cake to his
mam-ma, who did cry and
sob, and look so sad, that
Ann had to cry too.</p>

<p>She went home and told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
her mam-ma all this bad news;
and all the rest of the day she
felt sad, and her kind face was
pale.</p>

<p>When it was time to go to
bed, Ann did pray to God for
the poor boy. She did beg
the good God to save his life,
and she did beg Him to make
her a good girl, and to love
her and love her dear mam-ma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and take care of them
both. She did pray that God
would make her good and kind
to poor old Aunt Peg, and to
all she knew, and to let her be
His lamb, to live with Him
when she died.</p>

<p>Then her mam-ma gave her
a kiss, and saw that she lay
warm in her nice, soft bed,
and went out of the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
She left Ann in the dark. But
let me tell you she did not
care for that; no, not a bit!
Ann had no fear, for she knew
that God took care of her;
she knew that God did love
a good girl.</p>

<h2>JOE, WHO DID NOT MIND.</h2>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;my! what a cold
day!" said Tom;
"I am sure the
pond is all ice.
What fun it will
to run my sled on
it! Come, Joe, get
your sled, and I will race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
home and get mine, and we
will have a real good time."</p>

<p>"O no! I can not," said
Joe; "pa-pa told me not to
go on the pond to-day; he
said the ice was too thin."</p>

<p>"Stuff! the ice is two feet
deep, <i>I</i> know. Come, it will
not hurt you, and then you
need not <i>tell</i>. Don't be such
a gump. Go, get your sled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
I tell you. Come; one! two!
three! Why don't you run?"</p>

<p>"W-e-ll," said Joe in a slow
way, "if the ice is as deep as
you say, I will just try it; that
can do no harm, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you need not say
a word when you come back,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>Do you not see what a bad
boy this was? If a boy or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
girl tells you <i>not</i> to mind your
pa-pa or mam-ma, I beg you
to run away from them as if
they were a bear or a wild cat,
come to bite your head off;
for, let me tell you, a bad boy
or a bad girl will do you more
harm than a wild bear or cat;
they will make you bad too;
and you will be sure to come
to harm, just as Joe did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>For he got his sled and
Tom got his, and they ran
off to the pond.</p>

<p>It was full of boys, and for
an hour or two, our two boys
had fine fun. They all slid
down the pond in a long line;
and if one fell down and hit
his nose, he did not mind it
a bit, but got up and went
on, with a grin on his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Then they got each sled in a
line, and with a cry of one!
two!! three!!! ran a race;
and were just as full of fun
and glee as an egg is full of
meat.</p>

<p>At last a fat boy, who did
not like to run so fast, said:
"See here, boys, I have got a
big kite home; I will go and
get it, and then you will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
fun! for the wind and my kite
will give me a ride on my
sled."</p>

<p>"O dear, yes! won't that
be nice!" said all the boys, as
the fat one ran off with a hop,
skip, and jump.</p>

<p>As he did not have far to
go, he soon came back with
his big kite; and then he sat
down on his sled and let his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
kite out, and, whoo!! how he
flew down the pond! He had
to hold the cord as hard as
he could. His face was full
of joy at such a fine ride;
and the rest of the boys ran
and slid, first on one foot,
and then on two; but they
did not go half so fast as the
fat boy on his sled.</p>

<p>He was a good, kind boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and let them all have a ride
with the kite in turn. When
Joe's turn came, he was in
such joy, that he did not care
a snap for what his pa-pa had
said to him. "Oh!" he did
cry, "what fun! I want to stay
here all day. I tell you what!
I mean to make a big kite, and
come here some time, and ride
on my sled all day long."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>He held the fat boy's kite
then, and his sled went down
the pond like the wind.</p>

<p>Snap! snap!! what was
that? snap! snap!! snap!!!</p>

<p>The boys made a rush to
the spot; a wild cry rose in
the air of "Save me! O save
me!" and down went poor Joe
thro' a hole in the ice. The
cord that held the kite flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
out of his hand; a great lump
of ice sank for a time; and
then all that was seen of Joe
was his cap, and his sled that
came, up-side down, to the top
of the pond.</p>

<p>All the boys grew pale with
fear. They did not know what
to do.</p>

<p>As they did look with wild,
sad eyes at the dark hole in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the ice, Joe's head came up,
and his hand took hold of the
edge of the ice. With a grasp
and a cry of "Save me!" he
drew him-self up till his face
was out of the wa-ter; but that
was all. Oh! how he did wish
he had done as his pa-pa had
bid him! With a wild look up
at the cold blue sky, he did try
to pray. He knew that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
saw him. He knew how bad
he had been. He held fast by
the edge of the ice, with his
face up, and his head back, to
keep his face from the cold
edge that cut him; and his
cry was: "Save me! O save
me!"</p>

<p>The boys came as near to
him as it was safe to go&mdash;all
but Tom. He ran off. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
not try to help the one he
had told to be so bad. Oh!
do you not see that a boy
like this will do you more
harm than good? If you
know such a boy or girl, do
not play with them; give them
up this day.</p>

<p>Well, here was poor Joe,
and God did hear his cry for
help; for just then it was His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
will that two men came by
with a sled full of wood. The
boys did call them: "Come
here, oh! do come here! or
Joe will die!"</p>

<p>It was time; for the poor
boy had sunk down, down to
his eyes. He was so cold, he
had to let go of the ice.</p>

<p>The good men ran to the
pond, and then ran back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
took a long rope, that they
had used to tie the load of
wood. Then, with care, one
of them went on the ice near
the hole. Snap! snap! it did
go; but it did not sink. The
man threw out the rope, and
told Joe to take hold of the
end. He was so cold he
could not hold it; but he
put the end un-der his arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and in this way the man drew
him out so far that he took
hold of his hand, and got him
safe on the hard ice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="i018.jpg" id="i018.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/i018.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="The man drew him out" title="The Man Drew Him Out" />
    <p class="caption">"In this way the man drew him out."&mdash;<a href="#Page_173">P. 173.</a><br /><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Then poor Joe gave one
gasp, shut his eyes, and sank
down as if he was dead.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost.
"Take the wood off the sled,"
said one of the men. The
boys flew to do it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
wood fell this side and that;
and then poor Joe was laid
on the sled, with his head on
the good man's lap. He took
off his coat, and laid it on the
poor boy; and then the sled
went off so fast, that they
were at Joe's house in time
to save him.</p>

<p>But, oh! what a sad time
it was! How long it took!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
They put him in a warm bed,
and they did rub and roll him
for an hour; but still his eyes
were shut, and his face was
so pale, they all said he was
dead. But his mam-ma did
cry: "O do not stop! try once
more! My dear boy must not
die! Oh! do not give him
up!" So they went on; his
pa-pa with the big tears in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
eyes; and the kind men they
did rub and roll him, and his
mam-ma sat by, with a pale,
sad face, to help, and she did
not give up hope; she did
pray to God all the time to
save her boy's life.</p>

<p>Hark! what was that? A
low moan came from Joe's
lips, then a sigh, then a gasp;
then he said in a low tone:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
"How did I come here in
bed? Oh! what pain I am
in!&mdash;oh! how I ache!"</p>

<p>All at once the pond and
his fall thro' the ice came
back to his mind, and then
the pain of his mind was, oh!
so hard to bear! and he said:
"O my dear pa-pa! my dear
mam-ma! do not be kind to
me! I am a bad, bad boy. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
did not do as you bid me;
I went on the pond, and I fell
in. Oh! you can not love
me! I have been so bad! I
wish you had let me die!
Oh! how can you be kind
to such a bad boy?"</p>

<p>"My dear son," said his pa-pa,
"God does not wish you
to die. He will give you back
your life, so that you may try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to be good all the rest of your
days."</p>

<p>"But are you glad to get
me back? Will you and mam-ma
love me? If you can not
love me, I want to die."</p>

<p>His mam-ma took him in
her arms, and gave him a kiss,
and told him she did love him,
and that he must not wish to
die, but try to be good. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
must pray to God to help
him, and he must not go with
bad boys; and she did look
so kind, that Joe put his arms
on her neck, and felt glad.</p>

<p>He was ill a long time, for
he took a sad cold. But he
did what he was bid. He did
not fret a bit, but had a kiss
and a kind word for all who
took care of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>When he got well, he did
not go near that bad boy,
Tom, who had made him to
sin, and then when he was in
such a sad way, and like to
die, ran off. For you know
when Joe sank down thro' the
hole in the ice, Tom did not
help him, but, like a bad, mean
boy, ran away. All bad boys
and girls act so; they will get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
you to sin, and then when
you are in pain, and want to
get rid of your sin, they will
not help you. Not they! So
keep far away from all such,
if you wish to lead a good
life. Do not go with bad
boys or girls, who will tell
you not to mind your pa-pa
and mam-ma, who are sure
to know what is best for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Joe got well, and he grew
up a good boy and good man.
He is a man now, and when
he is told to do what is bad,
he says to him-self: "This is
like Tom; this will get me
into a hole, like the hole in
the ice; I will not do it."</p>

<p>Do <i>you</i> do as you are bid?
Oh! I hope so. If you do not&mdash;mind
what I now tell you&mdash;take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
this book back to your
mam-ma, and tell her, I do
not wish a bad boy or girl to
have it; and beg her to keep
it till you are good; and when
you are so, ask for the book,
and then do come and give
me a kiss, and it will make
me sing for joy.</p>
